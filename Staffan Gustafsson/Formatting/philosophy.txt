Western philosophy is the philosophical tradition of the Western world and dates
to Pre-Socratic thinkers who were active in Ancient Greece in the 6th century BCE
such as Thales (c. 624–546 BCE) and Pythagoras (c. 570–495 BCE) who practiced a
"love of wisdom" (philosophia) and were also termed physiologoi (students of physis,
    or nature). Socrates was a very influential philosopher, who insisted that
he possessed no wisdom but was a pursuer of wisdom. Western philosophy can be
divided into three eras: Ancient (Greco-Roman), Medieval philosophy (Christian European),
and Modern philosophy.
The Ancient era was dominated by Greek philosophical schools which arose out of the
various pupils of Socrates, such as Plato who founded the Platonic Academy, and was
one of the most influential Greek thinkers for the whole of Western thought. Plato's

that, quite frankly, I can't help but to feel a bit overwhelmed. There is
not much to do. But just as in many other situatations in
life, the support and love from friends and family, and often times from a community
like the one around PowerShell, is invaluable!
student Aristotle was also extremely influential, founding the Peripatetic school.
Other traditions include Cynicism, Stoicism, Greek Skepticism and
Epicureanism. Important topics covered by the Greeks included metaphysics
(with competing theories such as atomism and monism), cosmology, the nature
of the well-lived life (eudaimonia), the possibility of knowledge and the
nature of reason (logos). With the rise of the Roman empire, Greek philosophy
was also increasingly discussed in Latin by Romans such as Cicero and Seneca.
Medieval philosophy (5th – 16th century) is the period following the fall of
the western Roman empire and was dominated by the rise of Christianity and hence reflects
Judeo-Christian theological concerns as well as retaining a continuity with Greco-Roman thought.
