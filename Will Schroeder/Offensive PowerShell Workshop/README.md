# The Power of the Dark Side: Offensive PowerShell Workshop 

These files are for the Offensive PowerShell Workshop run by Will Schroeder and Jared Atkinson.

Because some of these files are often flagged by anti-virus, the .zip is encrypted with the password __"PSConfEU!"__ without the quotes. Extract the .zip to an exclude folder for your local anti-virus to ensure the files are not removed.

## Third party files

There are a number of third party files that will be used in the workshop that we do not have the rights to redistribute.
